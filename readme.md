# LoveReload for old 32-bit Mac
## Supported by users

If you have 32-but Mac and want to use LiveReload, you can support this 32-bit version.

It's easy: if module that you need (HAML compiler, for example) is not work â€“ just create issue and I will try to fix it.

Or you can fork this repo, update broken module (fix problem) and push the solution to this repo.

Checked and workable modules:

- Stylus compiler
- //check other modules and tell me about issues//
